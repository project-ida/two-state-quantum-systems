    "So far, we've described a combined TLS + quantum field using a notation like, e.g. $|0,+,-,-,- \\rangle$. The first number (in this case $0$) tells us the number of bosons present (this is often referred to as a [Fock state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fock_state)), and the $\\pm$ tell us what state each of the $N$ TLS are in ($+$ excited, $-$ ground). This is a complete description in the sense that every configuration of the system can be described as a mixture of these states. For example, a single excitation delocalised across 4 TLS with no bosons can be described by:\n",

Superficially, we'd be quite happy with a simpler description like $| n, n_+ \\rangle$ - where $n$ is the boson number and $n_+$ is the number of excitations. There are only $N+1$  possibilities for the state of the TLS in this case - this is much more favourable from a computational perspective. \n",

In general, the specific $j$, $m$ combinations come from adding up the angular momentum for many single TLS (with $j=1/2$) like vectors of the same length but different (quantised) orientations. The details are somewhat tedious - often involving [formidable lookup tables](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-clebsch-gordan-coefs.pdf). Luckily for us, QuTiP, has some convenient functions (that are somewhat hidden inside of [`qutip.cy.piqs`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/85632bc66fdcd45be51e1c280ea7577f04761a67/qutip/cy/piqs.pyx)) to help us.\n",
