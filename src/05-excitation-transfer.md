## Recap

$$H =  \frac{\Delta E}{2} \sigma_z + \hbar\omega\left(a^{\dagger}a +\frac{1}{2}\right) + U\left( a^{\dagger} + a \right)\sigma_x$$

States described as $|n,\pm \rangle$

For example, if we only allow `max_bosons=4`

```python
max_bosons=4
```

We can enumerate the states as

```python
# map from QuTiP number states to |n,¬±, ¬±> states
possible_ns = range(0, max_bosons+1)
possible_ms = ["+","-"]
nm_list = [(n,m1) for (n,m1) in product(possible_ns, possible_ms)]
```

```python
nm_list
```

and we can represent e.g. $|1, +\rangle$ using the tensor product that we learnt about in [Tutorial 3](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/project-ida/two-state-quantum-systems/blob/master/03-a-two-state-system-in-a-quantised-field.ipynb#3.5---Describing-coupled-systems-in-QuTiP) and 4.

```python
#        bosons,                TSS1, 
tensor(basis(max_bosons+1,1), basis(2,0))
```

<!-- #region -->
We did similar things with the operators that make up the Hamiltonian


- `two_state` = $\frac{1}{2}\sigma_z$
- `bosons` = $a^{\dagger}a +\frac{1}{2}$
- `interaction`= $\left( a^{\dagger} + a \right)\sigma_x$
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
a  = tensor(destroy(max_bosons+1), qeye(2))     # tensorised boson destruction operator
sx = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), sigmax())       # tensorised ùúéùë• operator
sz = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1),sigmaz())        # tensorised ùúéùëß operator

two_state     =  1/2*sz                         # two state system energy operator   ùúéùëß/2
bosons       =  (a.dag()*a+0.5)                 # boson energy operator              ùëé‚Ä†ùëé+1/2
number        = a.dag()*a                       # boson number operator              ùëé‚Ä†ùëé
interaction  = (a.dag() + a) * sx               # interaction energy operator        (ùëé‚Ä†+ùëé)ùúéùë•  
```

We can extend these tensor products to include extra TSS easily. Let's see


## 2 TSS

$$H =  \frac{\Delta E}{2} (\sigma_{z1} + \sigma_{z2}) + \hbar\omega\left(a^{\dagger}a +\frac{1}{2}\right) + U\left( a^{\dagger} + a \right)(\sigma_{x1} + \sigma_{x2})$$

States described as $|n,\pm, \pm \rangle$

Again, if we only allow `max_bosons=4`, then we can enumerate the states in a very similar way to a single TSS


```python
H_latex = "$H = \Delta E /2 (\sigma_{z1} + \sigma_{z2}) + \hbar\omega(a^{{\dagger}}a +1/2) + U( a^{{\dagger}} + a )(\sigma_{x1} +\sigma_{x2} )$ "
```

```python
max_bosons=4
```

```python
# map from QuTiP number states to |n,¬±, ¬±> states
possible_ns = range(0, max_bosons+1)
possible_ms = ["+","-"]
nmm_list = [(n,m1,m2) for (n,m1,m2) in product(possible_ns, possible_ms, possible_ms)]
```

```python
nmm_list
```

the state  $|1,+, + \rangle$ is then represented by:

```python
#           bosons,             TSS1,        TSS2
tensor(basis(max_bosons+1,1), basis(2,0), basis(2,0))
```

Now for the operators.

- `two_state_1` = $\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{z1}$
- `two_state_2` = $\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{z2}$
- `bosons` = $a^{\dagger}a +\frac{1}{2}$
- `interaction_1`= $\left( a^{\dagger} + a \right)\sigma_{x1}$
- `interaction_2`= $\left( a^{\dagger} + a \right)\sigma_{x2}$

```python
a     = tensor(destroy(max_bosons+1), qeye(2), qeye(2))     # tensorised boson destruction operator
sx1   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), sigmax(), qeye(2))       # tensorised ùúéùë•1 operator 
sx2   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), qeye(2), sigmax())       # tensorised ùúéùë•2 operator 
sz1   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), sigmaz(), qeye(2))       # tensorised ùúéz1 operator 
sz2   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), qeye(2), sigmaz())       # tensorised ùúéz2 operator 

two_state_1     =  1/2*sz1                             # two state system energy operator   ùúéùëß1/2
two_state_2     =  1/2*sz2                             # two state system energy operator   ùúéùëß2/2
bosons          = (a.dag()*a+0.5)                      # boson energy operator              ùëé‚Ä†ùëé+1/2
number          = a.dag()*a                            # boson number operator              ùëé‚Ä†ùëé
interaction_1   = (a.dag() + a) * sx1                  # interaction energy operator       (ùëé‚Ä†+ùëé)ùúéùë•1  
interaction_2   = (a.dag() + a) * sx2                  # interaction energy operator       (ùëé‚Ä†+ùëé)ùúéùë•2 
```

In tutorial 4, we learnt a lot from looking at the Hinton diagram of the Hamiltonian. Let's do the same here.

Let's use example Hamiltonian with $\Delta E = \omega = U = 1$ for this test.

```python
H = 1*two_state_1 + 1*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 1*interaction_1 + 1*interaction_2
```

```python
bra_labels, ket_labels = make_braket_labels(nmm_list)
```

```python
f, ax = hinton(H, xlabels=ket_labels, ylabels=bra_labels)
ax.tick_params(axis='x',labelrotation=90,)
ax.set_title("Matrix elements of H     (Fig 1)");

```

As we might have imagined the Hinton diagram is more complicated than for a single TSS. Each state is connected to twice as many states as previously. For example, $|0,+, + \rangle$ is directly coupled to the following 2 states:
- $|1,+, - \rangle$
- $|1,-, + \rangle$

Just like the last tutorial, we can start to draw a sequence of horizontal and vertical line to see how the states are connected. There are many more paths now that we have an extra TSS. Let's look at one such path.

>TODO: draw path Fig 2

$|0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |1,+, - \rangle \rightarrow |2,-, - \rangle \rightarrow |3,+, - \rangle \rightarrow |4,-, - \rangle$

We can expect that the indirect path from $|0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |2,-, - \rangle$ could be realised by setting $\Delta E = \omega$ so that a boson would be emitted by each TSS as they transition from + to -. We've seen similar physics from a single TSS - nothing controversial here.

We can also expect (similarly to the previous tutorial) that the indirect path from $|0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |4,-, - \rangle$ could be realised by setting $\Delta E = 2\omega$ so that 2 bosons would be emitted by each TSS as they transition from + to -.  This is another example of down conversion that we found last time.


We can make also paths like below

>TODO: draw paths  Fig 3

$|1,+, - \rangle \rightarrow |0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |1,-, + \rangle$

This is something different to what we encountered before - how would we describe such paths? We could call the indirect path from $|1,+, - \rangle \rightarrow |1,-, + \rangle$   excitation transfer because the "excitation" (i.e. the +) moves from one TSS to the other.



---
In tutorial 4 we discovered that two distinct parity universes existed which can be treated in isolation

We could distinguish the parity using the operator $\sigma_z e^{i\pi n}$ where $n$ is the boson number operator.

A simple extension of this idea for 2 TSS is simply  $\sigma_{z1}\sigma_{z2} e^{i\pi n}$. Let's see what it looks like

```python
P = sz1*sz2*(1j*np.pi*number).expm()              # parity operator
```

```python
bra_labels, ket_labels = make_braket_labels(nmm_list)
```

```python
f, ax = hinton(P, xlabels=ket_labels, ylabels=bra_labels)
ax.tick_params(axis='x',labelrotation=90)
ax.set_title("Matrix elements of H     (Fig 4)");
```

It takes on a binary $\pm 1$ as we saw in the last tutorial. The most important question is, does it commute with the Hamiltonian - if it does that we have a well defined parity operator that we can use to split the universes.

Let's use example Hamiltonian with $\Delta E = \omega = U = 1$ for this test.

```python
H = 1*two_state_1 + 1*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 1*interaction_1 + 1*interaction_2
```

```python
commutator(H,P).full
```

Great! We are now ready to put this all together in much the same way we did in the last tutorial, i.e. we create a function.

```python
def make_operators(max_bosons, parity=0):
    
    a     = tensor(destroy(max_bosons+1), qeye(2), qeye(2))     # tensorised boson destruction operator
    sx1   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), sigmax(), qeye(2))       # tensorised ùúéùë•1 operator 
    sx2   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), qeye(2), sigmax())       # tensorised ùúéùë•2 operator 
    sz1   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), sigmaz(), qeye(2))       # tensorised ùúéz1 operator 
    sz2   = tensor(qeye(max_bosons+1), qeye(2), sigmaz())       # tensorised ùúéz2 operator

    number          = a.dag()*a                                 # boson number operator              ùëé‚Ä†ùëé
    interaction_1   = (a.dag() + a) * sx1                       # interaction energy operator       (ùëé‚Ä†+ùëé)ùúéùë•1

    # map from QuTiP number states to |n,¬±, ¬±> states
    possible_ns = range(0, max_bosons+1)
    possible_ms = ["+","-"]
    nmm_list = [(n,m1,m2) for (n,m1,m2) in product(possible_ns, possible_ms, possible_ms)]
    
    # only do parity extraction if a valid parity is being used
    if (parity==1) | (parity==-1):
        p           = np.where(P.diag()==parity)[0]
        
        two_state_1     = two_state_1.extract_states(p)
        two_state_2     = two_state_2.extract_states(p)
        bosons          = bosons.extract_states(p)
        number          = number.extract_states(p)
        interaction_1   = interaction_1.extract_states(p)
        interaction_2   = interaction_2.extract_states(p)
        nmm_list        = [nmm_list[i] for i in p]
    
    
    return two_state_1, two_state_2, bosons, interaction_1, interaction_2, number, nmm_list
```

### Energy level landscape $U=0$

# ODD PARITY

two_state_1, two_state_2, bosons, interaction_1, interaction_2, number, nmm_list = make_operators(
    max_bosons=6, parity=-1)

for i, row in df_odd.iterrows():
    H =  row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_1+ row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_2 + 1*bosons 
    evals, ekets = H.eigenstates()

<!-- #region -->
What can we say about Figs 5 and 6?

Compared to Fig 1 of tutorial 3, we have some similarities and some differences:
- Similarity - levels that trend up and down with $\Delta E$. These correspond to states like $|n,+,+\rangle$ and $|n,-,-\rangle$
- Difference - horizontal levels. These correspond to combinations of $|n,+,-\rangle$ and $|n,-,+\rangle$ which give is no overall "excitation" i.e. equal amounts of + and -. This kind of combination of basis states is often referred to as an [entangled state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement#Pure_states). 
 >The subject of quantum entanglement deserves at least a whole tutorial, so we'll come back to it another time.


Thinking now more carefully about the horizontal levels, there are 2 ways we can combine these states together for a given $n$:
- $|n,+,-\rangle + |n,-,+\rangle$ 
- $|n,+,-\rangle  - |n,-,+\rangle$ 

These states are reminiscent of the "in phase" and "out of phase" states that we described back in tutorial 1.  The two combinations give us an expectation that each horizontal line is in fact 2 horizontal lines on top of each other.

What else can we say?

When looking at where the levels appear to cross, we now suspect that there are two different situations:
- 2 levels come together - we've seen this before and we expect these to form anti-crossings when we switch the coupling on
- 4 levels come together - we've not encountered this before so we need to explore it.

Let's focus on even parity for now, i.e Fig 6, and switch on the coupling.
<!-- #endregion -->

## Crossings and anti-crossings

```python
# EVEN PARITY

two_state_1, two_state_2, bosons, interaction_1, interaction_2, number, nmm_list = make_operators(
    max_bosons=6, parity=1)

df_even = make_df_for_energy_scan("$\Delta E$", -4, 4, 201, two_state_1.shape[0])

for i, row in df_even.iterrows():
    H =  row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_1+ row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.1*interaction_1 + 0.1*interaction_2
    evals, ekets = H.eigenstates()
    df_even.iloc[i,1:] = evals 
```

```python
df_even.plot(x="$\Delta E$",ylim=[-0.5,5.5],legend=True, 
        title=f"Even stationary states for {H_latex}   ($\omega=1$, $U=0.1$)   (Fig 7)",
             figsize=(10,8));

plt.ylabel("Energy");

```

There are many things we can see from Fig 7:
1. Where 2 levels have come together we see an anti-crossing as we have come to expect from interacting levels, e.g. levels 4 and 5.
2. The horizontal levels of Fig 6 have split into 2 levels as we suspected. This reveals that 4 levels are indeed coming together at some anti-crossings, e.g. levels 1,2,3,4
3. One of the previously horizontal levels appears to remain horizontal, i.e. it is unaffected by the coupling
4. There appear to still be genuine crossings between some levels, most strikingly seen at the intersection of levels 2 and 3 - this indicates there might be non interacting sub-universes with each parity universe ü§Ø

There is a lot to explore and understand, let's start with point 1, i.e. two levels anti-crossing - this is the most familiar to us, then move onto looking at 3 and 4 in States with no overall excitation before returning to 2 in "Beyond two level anti-crossings"


### Two Level anti-crossing

Levels 4 an 5 anti-cross at around $\Delta E = 2\omega$. This anti-crossing looks like it could be linked to the $|0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |4,-, - \rangle$ down conversion that we talked about when we explored the Hinton diagram.

Let's see if we can simulation such down conversion just as we did in Fig 12 of tutorial 4. Rather than manually zoom in on the anti-crossing to get a more precise value of $\Delta E$ to use in the simulation, we will automate the process using [`minimize_scalar`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar.html) from [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar.html)


How will we use `minimize_scalar`? We first need to provide a function that calculates the difference in the energies of two levels.

```python
def level_difference(DeltaE, omega, U, level_number):
    H = DeltaE*two_state_1 + DeltaE*two_state_2 + omega*bosons + U*interaction_1 + U*interaction_2
    evals, ekets = H.eigenstates()
    return np.abs(evals[level_number] - evals[level_number-1])

```

We can now pass this `level_difference` to `minimise_scalar` where the first argument will be used by `minimize_scalar` as a variable and the rest will be considered as "arguments" (i.e. fixed constants). Finally, we must specify $\Delta E$ `bounds` in which we expect to find the anti-crossing.

Let's give it a go using:
- `omega = 1`
- `U = 0.1`
- `level_number = 5`
- `bounds = [1.9, 2]`

```python
# oemga = 1
# U = 0.1
# level_number 5 - this will allow us to calculate level_5/4 energy difference
anti_crossing = minimize_scalar(level_difference, args=(1, 0.1, 5), method="Bounded", bounds=[1.9, 2])
```

```python
anti_crossing
```

We see that the true anti-crossing occurs at $\Delta E = 1.9328593467366724$. Let's now use this value to create the Hamiltonian for our simulation.

```python
H = anti_crossing.x*two_state_1 + anti_crossing.x*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.1*interaction_1 + 0.1*interaction_2
```

We want to start the system off in the $|0,+, + \rangle$ state - this should be the first state in the state list, let's check

```python
nmm_list[0]
```

```python
nmm_list
```

Great. We can now set up the initial state by using the `basis` function as we have done before.

```python
psi0 = basis(len(nmm_list), 0)
```

Now we are ready to simulate

```python
times = np.linspace(0.0, 100000.0, 10000)
P, psi = simulate(H, psi0, times)
```

```python
bra_labels, ket_labels = make_braket_labels(nmm_list)
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
for i in range(0,P.shape[0]):
    plt.plot(times, P[i,:], label=f"{ket_labels[i]}")
plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.legend(loc="right")
plt.title(f"2 TSS with {H_latex}  ($\Delta E = 1$, $\omega=1$, $U=0.001$)   (Fig 8)")
plt.show();


```

Fig 8 does indeed show down conversion that we expected to see, i.e. both TSS transition from + to - giving of 2 bosons in the process, i.e. $|0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |4,-, - \rangle$.


### States with no overall excitation


From fig xx, we found something unexpected for the energy levels corresponding to no overall excitation, i.e. those consisting of equal number of + and -. 
- It seemed like one of the levels remains horizontal even though we turned the coupling on.
- It seems like the energy levels with no overall excitation can actually cross 

What are these observations telling us?

We'll first set $\Delta E = 0$ and inspect levels 2 and 3

```python
DeltaE = 0
```

```python
H = DeltaE*two_state_1 + DeltaE*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.1*interaction_1 + 0.1*interaction_2
```

```python
evals, ekets = H.eigenstates()
```

Let's look at the energy of levels 2 and 3

```python
evals[2:4]
```

level 3 is exactly 1.5 as it was when we didn't have any coupling between the TSS and the boson field.

```python
prettify_states(ekets, nmm_list)[[2,3]]
```

We can see that levels 2 and 3 are normlaised versions of: 
- level 2 = $|1,+,-\rangle  + |1,-,+\rangle$ +  other states with boson number different from 1
- level 3 = $|1,+,-\rangle  - |1,-,+\rangle$ 

This pattern persists as we change $\Delta E$, i.e. there is always a level corresponding to  $|1,+,-\rangle  - |1,-,+\rangle$ and it's energy is always 1.5 - try it out for yourself by changing the $\Delta E$ in the above Hamiltonian.

So, it seems to be true that the state $|1,+,-\rangle  - |1,-,+\rangle$ (and others like it with different boson number) live in their own independent sub-universe and don't interact with the other states. What is the physics behind this? Why is it that changing plus to minus in $|1,+,-\rangle  \pm |1,-,+\rangle$ makes such a difference? It's an important question but one that takes us somewhat away from the primary mission of this tutorial. We'll come back to this in the next tutorial.

> For those who just can't wait that long, it has to do with angular momentum and spin

We can now be quite confident that when we see an anti-crossing where 4 levels come together it's actually only 3 levels that are interacting to produce the energy splitting and the other level is just a non interacting level of the form $|n,+,-\rangle  - |n,-,+\rangle$.


## Beyond simple anti-crossings


The "anti-crossing" around $\Delta E = 1$ looks like it could be related to the $|0,+, + \rangle \rightarrow |2,-, - \rangle$ transition that we spoke of earlier which is mediated by the staes $|1,+, - \rangle$ and $|1,-, + \rangle$. Let's zoom in a take a closer look.

```python
# EVEN PARITY

two_state_1, two_state_2, bosons, interaction_1, interaction_2, number, nmm_list = make_operators(
    max_bosons=6, parity=1)

df_even = make_df_for_energy_scan("$\Delta E$", 0.7, 1.3, 201, two_state_1.shape[0])

for i, row in df_even.iterrows():
    H =  row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_1+ row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.1*interaction_1 + 0.1*interaction_2
    evals, ekets = H.eigenstates()
    df_even.iloc[i,1:] = evals 
```

```python
df_even.plot(x="$\Delta E$",ylim=[1,2],legend=True, 
        title=f"Even stationary states for {H_latex}   ($\omega=1$, $U=0.1$)    (Fig 9)",
             figsize=(10,8));

plt.ylabel("Energy");
```

When we look at levels 2 and 3 in Fig 9, we should try and ignore the horizontal part (the non interactive level) and instead imagine the "S" looking curve is a single energy level - let's call it level S.

We can immediately see that the notion of an anti-crossing is now somewhat ill defined because things don't look very symmetric. In particular:
- The extrema of the upper (purple) and lower (orange) levels don't occur at the same $\Delta E$
- The upper and lower levels come closest to the middle level S at $\Delta E$ that does not coincide with their extrema

This makes it difficult to choose an appropriate $\Delta E$ for the simulation. We know that as $U \rightarrow 0$, all the levels come together at $\Delta E=1 $, so let's reduce $U$ by a factor of 10 to $U=0.01$ and set $\Delta E=1 $ for this simulation and see how we get on.

```python
H = 1*two_state_1 + 1*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.01*interaction_1 + 0.01*interaction_2
```

```python
psi0 = basis(len(nmm_list), 0)
```

```python
times = np.linspace(0.0, 1000.0, 10000)
P, psi = simulate(H, psi0, times)
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
for i in range(0,P.shape[0]):
    plt.plot(times, P[i,:], label=f"{ket_labels[i]}")
plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.legend(loc="right")
plt.title(f"2 TSS with {H_latex}  ($\Delta E = 1$, $\omega=1$, $U=0.001$)   (Fig 10)")
plt.show();



```

Fig 10 shows the emission of a single boson from each TSS as we predicted when we explored the Hinton diagram.

>As an aside, you might be wondering why we don't see a full oscillation in probability from 1 to 0 for $|0,+,+ \rangle$ and $|2,-,- \rangle$. We saw in Tutorial 4, that as the boson number increased the separation in levels at anti-crossings also increased - this tells us that the boson number is involved in the amount of coupling between any two levels. Because $|0,+,+ \rangle \rightarrow |2,-,- \rangle$ involves the coupling of 3 levels of different boson number (the third being the intermediate level $|1,+,-\rangle + |1,-,+\rangle$), an asymmetry develops and is then reflected in the time evolution of Fig 10.


Let's see if we can simulate the excitation transfer that we also discussed during our exploration of the Hinton diagram, i.e. the transition $|1,+, - \rangle \rightarrow  |1,-, + \rangle$. We should just be able to re run the above simulation with a different starting condition corresponding to $|1,+, - \rangle$ - which state is this in QuTiP?

```python
nmm_list
```

We need state number 2.

```python
nmm_list[2]
```

```python
psi0 = basis(len(nmm_list), 2)
times = np.linspace(0.0, 1000.0, 10000)
P, psi = simulate(H, psi0, times)
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
for i in range(0,P.shape[0]):
    plt.plot(times, P[i,:], label=f"{ket_labels[i]}")
plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.legend(loc="right")
plt.title(f"2 TSS with {H_latex}  ($\Delta E = 1$, $\omega=1$, $U=0.001$)   (Fig 11)")
plt.show();


```

<!-- #region -->
We can interpret the excitation transfer in Fig 11 in the following ways:
1. 

  - TSS_1 (the one initially in the "+" state) transitions to the lower "-" state releasing energy
  - The energy goes into emitting an extra boson, taking the field from 1 to 2 bosons
  - TSS_2 (the one initially in the "-" state) absorbs a boson taking the field from 2 to 1 boson
  
  
2. 
  - TSS_2 (the one initially in the "-" state) absorbs energy and transitions to upper "+" state
  - This energy comes from the boson field, taking the number of bosons from 1 to 0
  - TSS_1 (the one initially in "+" state) emits a boson taking the field from 0 to 1 boson
  
 
This mechanics as described above leads us to a mental model of excitation transfer as simply the exchange of bosons between one TSS and another - each boson transmitting the entire transition energy of the TSS. This is indeed one way that excitation transfer can occur, but it's not the only way. The entire transition energy $\Delta E$ can be conferred from one TSS to another without a single boson being emitted ü§Ø. Skeptical...you should be. Let's see it in action and then try and understand it.

## Non radiative excitation transfer 


We're going to perform a simulation with $\Delta E = 2.5\omega$ - it's not possible for an integer number of bosons to transmit the transition energy for our TSS. 

We'll again start the system in the state $|1,+,- \rangle$.

```python
H = 2.5*two_state_1 + 2.5*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.01*interaction_1 + 0.01*interaction_2
```

```python
psi0 = basis(len(nmm_list), 2)
times = np.linspace(0.0, 100000.0, 10000)
P, psi = simulate(H, psi0, times)
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
for i in range(0,P.shape[0]):
    plt.plot(times, P[i,:], label=f"{ket_labels[i]}")
plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.legend(loc="right")
plt.title(f"2 TSS with {H_latex}  ($\Delta E = 1$, $\omega=1$, $U=0.001$)   (Fig 12)")
plt.show();

```

As you can see, Fig 12 shows how excitation can be transfered from one TSS to another without bosons having any significant chance of being emitted.

How is it possible to have energy transfer without radiation? We can't do the topic justice in a single notebook, but what we can point to is the physics of wireless/inductive charging of devices. Energy gets transfered from one device to another but the energy isn't being radiation in the sense that we recognise from things like radio stations. In the context of quantum mechanics, such transfers of energy are made by virtual bosons.

In the context of our energy level diagrams, what we have the following:

```python
# EVEN PARITY

two_state_1, two_state_2, bosons, interaction_1, interaction_2, number, nmm_list = make_operators(
    max_bosons=6, parity=1)

df_even = make_df_for_energy_scan("$\Delta E$", 2.5, 2.6, 201, two_state_1.shape[0])

for i, row in df_even.iterrows():
    H =  row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_1+ row["$\Delta E$"]*two_state_2 + 1*bosons + 0.01*interaction_1 + 0.01*interaction_2
    evals, ekets = H.eigenstates()
    df_even.iloc[i,1:] = evals 
```

```python
df_even.plot(x="$\Delta E$",ylim=[1.499,1.501],legend=True, 
        title=f"Even stationary states for {H_latex}   ($\omega=1$, $U=0.1$)    (Fig 13)",
             figsize=(10,8));

plt.ylabel("Energy");
```

When we set our system up in the $|1,+,-\rangle$ state we are actually setting the system up in a state that's a mixture of levels 2 and 3. Although these levels don't interact with each other their energies are very close. As we cam to understand in Tutorial 1, when energies and therefore frequencies are close we can have beatings. The beat frequency is what's being manifested in Fig 12.

We can check period:

```python
delta = df_even.loc[0]["level_3"] - df_even.loc[0]["level_2"]

2*np.pi / delta
```

```python

```

```python

```
