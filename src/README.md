# Jupyter notebook source files

This folder contains what we call `source files` for the Jupyter notebooks in the home directory of this repo.

## What are notebook source files?

Notebook meta data and outputs are removed and the remaining content is converted into markdown format - this is then a `source file`.

## Why do we need notebook source files?
Without some kind of source file, version control of notebooks is extremely difficult.

## How do I create / update source files?

You don't need to - Github Actions automated the creation and updating when you push your changes to Github.
