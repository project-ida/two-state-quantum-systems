# two-state-quantum-systems

This repo is dedicated to exploring the dynamics of [two state quantum systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_quantum_system). There will be a particular focus will be the interaction of such systems with bosonic fields as exemplified in the [Jaynesâ€“Cummings model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynes%E2%80%93Cummings_model).
